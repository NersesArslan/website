        So ... the question. What is this all about? Why am I making a website
        to showcase myself to the online world? That's a very good question. I
        moved to Los Angeles in November 2021 after completing my M.A. in
        Philosophy at the American University of Beirut. I started working at an
        online Jewelry company in Downtown Los Angeles around January of 2022. A
        few months into my job I realized that I'd be struggling with feeling
        unhappy and unfulfilled if I didn't work on my career development.
