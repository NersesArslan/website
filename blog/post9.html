        I sat down with my friend Gen-san at a sushi restaurant. He asked me if
        I wanted to try this special sake that he said this restaurant had by
        reading the Japanese character off of a wall by our stall. I was a bit
        unsure if whether I should drink since I have pretty low tolerance to
        alcohol since I don't drink and because I was driving. Then at one point
        I blurted out "Yeah, let's fucking go for it!" He repeated "Fucking go
        for it!" and then Ashley, another friend who joined us smiled and said
        that it's funny how Gen-san is picking up slang and curse words from me.

        I first met Gen-san on a video call with my cousin Varant. My cousin
        Varant is a monk who has been training in Japan for several years. On
        one of our video calls he opened the video call with Gen-san in the
        frame and pointed to him. I forgot what he said, but the way he was
        pointing to him made me realize that this was someone important to him.
        This was long before I moved to Los Angeles, maybe a few years before.
        Varant told me that he, Gen-san, was trying really hard to learn how to
        speak English so that he can one day move to the US.

        I've seen him in other video calls and it was one of the only times I
        remember him wanting to introduce me to someone while we were on one of
        our calls. I don't know how often I've seen Gen-san in these calls with
        my cousin, and I don't know exactly how long I've seen him on our first
        call before I moved to Los Angeles. I would go on to move to the Zen
        center a few months into my moving to Los Angeles in late 2021. Gen-san
        would arrive about a year later, receiving training by an interim temple
        director so that he can help run the Zen Center.

        Gen-san's real name is Sogen. Gen-san is a kind of formal way of
        addressing in Japanese by taking the last syllable of one's first name
        (Gen from So-gen) and adding "-san" at the end. But I always call him
        Gen-san. "Sogen" has more serious, somber sound. Gen-san sounds, to me,
        lighthearted, playful, curious, adventurous and peaceful.

        I don't suppose that makes any sense. But the Gen-san that I know
        outside of the Zendo (the temple), is a fun and easygoing person to be
        around. The Gen-san I got to know during retreats and long sits in the
        Zendo is more focused, serious and intense. I suppose people do show up
        differently in different parts of their lives. I am not the same person
        I am at work and I allow different parts of myself to come out when I'm
        in a more casual setting with friends than when I'm at work.

        It's hard for me to describe what it is that made me feel close to
        Gen-san. It was difficult for us to communicate when he first arrived in
        Los Angeles. His English wasn't that good and I must have stopped
        sitting in the Zendo and being active in the community around that time.
        I do remember feeling a closeness with him when I started sitting at the
        temple regularly around some time when Gen-san was effectively running
        the Zen center on his own. I was pretty stressed out getting used to my
        new job and I was too tired from my commute home from work to sit in the
        Zendo. I felt bad because Gen-san did text me to come sit once in a
        while when I stopped going. I was very stubborn and defensive about not
        wanting to sit. But I eventually went back because ... I was pretty
        lonely. I was also struggling with stress and anxiety wondering if I
        would be able to hold down my new job. I was also still processing
        losing my dad the year before. I remember crying one time during one of
        our sits and even after the end of a sit I cried in front of him telling
        him how much I missed my dad and he comforted me.

        I think what drew us close was my sitting with him and being his

        when it was just me and him; of cleaning up and washing the tea cups ...
        I felt like the routine of doing that with him is what slowly made us
        get closer with one another.

        I eventually stopped sitting again. It was around the time my roommate
        Ron moved out. I have been going to Zendo a lot more often since last
        <a href="post8.html">March</a>. I felt like I have gotten a lot closer
        to Gen-san since then. He is my best friend.
