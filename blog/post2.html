        Success is achieving goals that you set for yourself. That is my issue
        with success or most people’s concept of success. That last goal I
        remember having is earning my Bachelor’s degree in college. For some
        reason I have had a fairly muddled idea of what I really want out of
        life since then. I have struggled a lot to have an idea of what I want
        to do with myself and have drifted from one point of my life to the next
        with a hazy idea of what it is I ought to be doing with myself.

        I never cared about money. That’s most probably because I never had to
        work for what I had and took it for granted that even the most basic
        thing I had access to – food, water, or a roof over my head – was
        because my father had worked his whole life to provide for me and my
        family. Even taking this into consideration, I derived very little
        pleasure in buying things or spending money. There were not a lot of
        things I could do with money that gave me real pleasure. I only liked
        buying books, coffee and spending time alone or with some close friends.
        I thought I would like to travel and see the world but I am not a good
        traveler. I did not get the most out of my trip to Austria and Germany
        in 2017 but I did feel invigorated when I saw that there was a world
        outside of my country. One that promised peace, prosperity and security.

        It is weird not to have had a job up until your late 20’s. I know for
        most Americans, let alone for most people in the world, that is an
        anomaly. You would have to come from a very well-off family or inherited
        a fortune to not have to work. I don’t know why I shirked work for so
        long. I was so convinced that I would become a successful scholar,
        teacher or academic by the time I started studying Philosophy that I had
        no qualms about not having a real job. I think that by spending so much
        time in college I had become accustomed to a way of life that involved
        living with my parents while living off an allowance well into my mid to
        late 20s. The reason I never wanted to work is two-fold: I never had any
        ambition outside of college and was provided for by my parents every
        step of the way. Over time, it became clear to me that I had to find
        work eventually since my parents cannot support me forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what does this have to do with my not knowing what I wanted to do
        with my life? It must be because I have spent so much time in college or
        university that I have developed a very warped sense of the world. I had
        a very narrow understanding of what the world was really like and what
        it took for people to live because everything I knew about the world is
        what I could read from the news, books or articles. I did not have to
        work 8 to 5 to provide for myself because I was already provided for. My
        idea of what I really wanted was to be an intellectual, to pursue truths
        and study some of the important questions about life. To genuinely live
        and learn about the examined life; to confront the human condition; to
        discuss, develop and share ideas; to become an academic. That is what I
        really wanted out of life, even when I was struggling with my mental
        health and could not study at a certain point.

        But now, with my situation as it is, i.e. having left Lebanon to start
        working Los Angeles because of the political and economic crises
        plaguing that country, what is it that I can set out to do to pursue my
        goals? Why did I shirk the opportunity to teach at a Community college
        or high school? Do I believer myself when I said “I lost my faith in
        education?” to one of my friends when she asked me why I don’t consider
        teaching? If I am honest with myself then the answer to that question is
        Yes and No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes: I have lost my faith that being a teacher, professor or academic
        can inspire real change in the world by teaching young students how to
        think. I am not denying that teaching can make a difference to the lives
        of students. I have lost faith that it actually makes a difference in
        society at large. A lot of this has to do with the privatization and
        commodification of education but I don’t want to get into that right
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        No: I have not lost my faith in education as a value. As something to
        pursue for the sake of it because one is committed to the idea of
        intellectual pursuits; of understanding the world, ourselves, our
        relationship between the world and ourselves and each other. I remember
        distinctly how much I struggled with one of my Metaphysics class in grad
        school only to realize later on that some of the concepts I learned in
        the class have still stuck around and shaped the way I view
        consciousness and its relationship to matter. I remember how hard I
        worked to understand the basic concepts of that class despite struggling
        to wrap my head around the arguments behind the philosophical positions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me go back to the main point I started off with: success is
        achieving goals that you set for yourself. In order to be successful by
        any metric, you need to have goals. To have goals, you need to know what
        you want. In order to know what you want, you need to know who you are.
        You cannot be successful on your own terms by setting goals for yourself
        that do not reflect what it is you really want out of life. You cannot
        be happy making a lot of money being a successful salesmen, an investor
        or a tech entrepreneur if you don’t know who you are or what it is you
        really value. You will be spending all your waking life hitting metrics
        and numbers to make more and more money so you can feel secure in the
        fact that you don’t have to worry about bills while being able to buy
        things that you never even thought were valuable. You will become the
        kind of person that you looked down on in college who was obsessed with
        wealth and status and you will be alienated from the person who you once
        were.

        I distinctly remember walking through Manhattan Beach with my cousin and
        his family on Sunday and thought to myself “how can I buy a house here?”
        I was so taken with the idea of living in such an upscale beach
        community that I really believed that I would achieve self-actualization
        by making enough money to buy a house on the beach front in Manhattan
        Beach. This is the trap so many people fall into when they grow up in a
        country that has so much money and opportunity. If you don’t know who
        you are or what it is that you really want, you fall into this trap of
        gratifying your desire to own property, to buy things, to eat at
        restaurants, only to spend most of your waking life working to make up
        for that lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would very much like to own a house in Manhattan Beach. I would not
        complain if I had millions of dollars coming my way. But I know that it
        would not give me peace or make me feel truly happy. What I really want
        is to gratify my intellectual and creative impulses. To challenge myself
        to write and think beyond the limits of what I think I am capable of. To
        make music and discuss politics, art and literature and somehow make a
        living out of it. That is how I can become successful on my own terms.
        That is the challenge that awaits me.
