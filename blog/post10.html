        I've been doing well lately, despite being dissatisfied with my job.
        Even then, it always seems that I stress about my work more in my mind,
        when I'm not at work, than when I'm actually at work.

        I finished reading Martin Amis' <em>Inside Story</em> a few days ago.
        The prose in that book was incredible. Amis knows how to make the reader
        feel welcome. His intimate, conversational style, coupled with his charm
        and wit, his incredible way with words and his biting sense of humor,
        made for a very pleasant read. I indulged in Martin Amis' prose. It made
        me want to spend more time reading well written prose and take another
        stab into writing. One of my biggest takeaways from the book is that
        there is reading, writing, the necessary isolation that comes with
        working on one's craft; and then there's life, all the things one has to
        do and maintain to keep oneself alive, healthy and sane.

        I started reading that book a few days before doing my first five day
        retreat (called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesshin">sesshin</a>.) My cousin
        Varant led the retreat. I signed up for this a few weeks, maybe just a
        little over a month before it started, but I have been wanting to do my
        first sesshin for several months. Ever since I started sitting
        consistently in the Zendo since last March.

        I cannot describe the experience with words. The attempt to try to
        describe it will taint it, stain it with fanciful ideas of awakening and
        enlightenment. I am not even sure what my intentions are with Zen
        practice beyond managing the stress and anxieties of day to day life. I
        am pretty sure my practice has more to do than just managing stress and
        anxiety at this point. I remember telling my temple director and this
        young student who was curious to learn more about Zen practice that
        practicing Zen for me has become something more than just alleviating
        stress and anxiety. It has become more about cultivating a practice to
        tap into a deeper, dormant spiritual life.

        Last Friday I got a call from my sister in the middle of work telling my
        that Israel launched another large airstrike aimed at
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah"
          >Hassan Nasrallah</a
        >. She said that they are still waiting to hear confirmation of his
        death. I thought to myself just there and then how ridiculous my
        concerns in my life were compared to the living conditions of people
        living in Lebanon. I thought myself lucky and grateful to be in the
        United States but I also was worried about my sister and my mom. My
        sister went back to Lebanon a few days before the strike despite knowing
        that the situation would get worse.

        The next day, Saturday morning, I had a hard time sitting in the Zendo.
        What the fuck am I doing practicing Zazen when the remaining members of
        my immediate family are in a country at war with Israel? How can I stick
        to my practice, how can I remain calm when the country I grew up in is
        getting pulverized by airstrikes? I grew more worried when I checked the
        news confirmed the Hassan Nasrallah's death the next day. What will this
        mean for Lebanon? What will this mean for the region, for the conflict
        at large? Will there ever be peace?
      </p>
      <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

      <!-- wp:paragraph -->
      <p>
        I thought I could have everything under control with my practice and my
        routine at work. I thought I could discipline my mind into maintaining a
        sense of inner calm even in the most difficult situations. I spent most
        of yesterday at home sleeping on the couch, not able to concentrate long
        enough to read or get any kind of work done. I felt restless, tired and
        useless. I lay still on the couch and allowed myself to feel what I was
        feeling. I did what I could to embrace the profound sense of
        helplessness and loneliness that I often felt when I'm alone over the
        weekends.

        It's ok to accept that I am not in control. It's ok to realize that no
        matter what I do there will be difficult circumstances up head that I
        can do nothing about. That realization is both frightening and
        liberating. To let go of that constant impulse to control the situation.
        To embrace the fear and helplessness, even if it means something
        happening to a close family member.

        A few weeks ago a former resident at the Zen center joined Gensan and me
        on a car ride to Santa Barbara. She was going through a hard time and it
        was obvious she was not doing well from the moment we reached our
        destination. It was obvious she needed care and support, but I was doing
        my best to help Gen-san setup his calligraphy gear in the dinning room
        so that we can give a calligraphy class to members of another Zen
        Center. The former resident stayed in the car when we first got to the
        house. I helped Gensan set up the ink, the felt pads where we were going
        to put the calligraphy paper on, and clean some of the brushes before
        setting them by the felt pads for use.

        A few people showed up at first, but more members came as time when on
        and it was becoming clear to me that the former resident who was by now
        sitting in the garden by herself, was going through a very hard time and
        that there was nothing anyone of us can do to help her. I felt a bit
        weird, a bit stupid for trying to focus on my brush strokes and improve
        my calligraphy when there is a woman having a nervous breakdown in the
        garden a few yard away from where I'm sitting. I felt calm, however, and
        was happy just to be around Gen-san and get to spend time with him on a
        long drive with him and get to get out of Los Angeles, even if it is for
        part of the day.

        I noticed something that day. That everyone suffers, even those that
        seem to have everything put together. I strongly felt that people spend
        a lot of energy putting on the impression that they are doing ok when in
        reality they are not. Seeing this former resident open up about some of
        the stuff she went through, a lot of stuff I don't even feel comfortable
        writing here despite not revealing her name, made me more sensitive to
        how everyone is fighting an inner battle day to day. It wasn't just her,
        but it was also the old people who showed up to the calligraphy class.
        They seem happy and in good spirits. But I noticed one of them going
        into the living to take a call and come back and repeat the news they
        got that one of their friends just got back from the doctor that their
        cancer results came back negative. These people are fighting their own
        battles that comes with old age. They may seem happy and healthy right
        now in front of me today, but I don't know the level and intensity of
        suffering they are experiencing on a day to day basis. They may seem
        like they live materially comfortable lives, but I have no idea what
        each one of them are going through. They just seemed happy to be out of
        the house and participate in a group activity. They seemed happy to make
        small talk and eat together. They were happy to have Gen-san over to
        give the calligraphy class.

        There is one thing I want to share with my experience at the sesshin. My
        cousin Varant gave talks each day of the sesshin. He gave some
        interesting talks throughout the whole retreat but one stuck with me. He
        said that he was very unhappy in his first year at the monastery in
        Japan. When he came back home after his first year at the monastery, he
        realized how unhappy he was. But he also realized how much he took for
        granted in Los Angeles. How much he depended on others. That's exactly
        how I felt for most of my life in Lebanon.
