        Los Angeles, I can hear Varant’s voice through the laptop speakers.
        “What are you looking for?”. This was weeks after I asked her out and
        started sitting in the Zendo to keep myself busy and preoccupied with
        the practice. You see Los Angeles, I couldn’t do anything but think of
        her and the loneliness and longing were so strong that the car rides
        home were painful and spending any time alone in a room was an
        opportunity to think about her and her boyfriend fucking. So I started
        sitting in the Zendo. It was around the same time the first Ango started
        and I sat. I sat for two hours after work from 7pm to 9pm. I remember
        the first time I sat next to Sylvain on the first day of my Ango and
        almost immediately I started breathing fast and I could feel myself
        trying to suppress what felt like heavy sudden breathing. I got up from
        my cushion and bowed to the Shoji and stepped out onto the Zendo porch
        trying to catch my breath. I thought to myself “I must really like this
        girl”. I went back in and I bowed to the Shoji and sat back on my
        cushion next to Sylvain.&nbsp;

        This was the beginning of my most consistent and intense Zen practice. I
        cried a lot. I couldn’t stop seeing images of her in my mind’s eye even
        when I kept my eyes open. I kept seeing her face, the smile when she
        approached me in the rave she invited me to. The dress she wore, her
        camera. I cried so much.

        I feel embarrassed writing about this now, Los Angeles. Doesn’t&nbsp;
        writing about this make it harder for me to move on? Am I not lingering
        and obsessing a little too much over this? Or will writing about it and
        thinking about it help me process it more so that I can fully understand
        myself and why I keep finding myself in these situations with girls. How
        much introspection is healthy and how much is pathological? I don’t
        know. But you saw me in those days coming home from work. Making my
        dinner, taking my shower and putting on my robes to head to the Zendo to
        sit. I started sitting on Saturday mornings. It was hard to get used to
        the different rituals and the order of bows at first. I didn’t even
        chant some of the chants they would chant in the morning so I had to get
        used to the rhythm and pace of those chants.&nbsp;

        I started talking to my new roommate Sylvain who moved in shortly before
        Ango. I asked him if Zen practice helps solve your problems. He asked me
        to be more concrete and I told him about my unrequited feelings for my
        coworker. We talked and talked. We talked even when we went on tangents
        and didn’t make sense. I don’t think we were supposed to be talking
        during Ango. But we talked and even he tried to restrain himself and
        told me that he was like a drug addict when it came to words. But we
        talked. That was the beginning of my friendship with Sylvain.

        I did not think I had it in me to hold down a job I didn't like for this
        long. I did not think I had it in me to ask out a girl that I liked that
        I work with. I did not think I had it in me to move to Los Angeles
        without a plan, without a job or an apartment. I honestly can't remember
        how I felt before I left. I must have not really felt or anticipated
        what was in store for me because of the craziness of the past few years
        before I moved. The truth is that I was unhappy long before I left
        Lebanon. I felt a great deep sadness and emptiness that I couldn't let
        go of and I knew it had something to do with my tendency to isolate
        myself. My grandma told me that other day that I used to smile and laugh
        all the time when I was a baby. Now that I'm an adult I look sad and
        worried because I'm starting to see how hard life really is. But she
        didn't know how sad I was before I moved Los Angeles. She didn't know
        that I tried to jump from the fourth floor of my dorm building when I
        was a sophomore in college. She didn't know that I met a guy in college
        the night before he died by suicide. She didn't know that I told him
        when we were in his dorm room that I tried to jump from the fourth floor
        of my dorm building. She didn't know that when I found out that he
        'slipped' from the 4th floor of his dorm building I felt bad because I
        thought I had given him the idea to kill himself that way.&nbsp;

        I really thought I was weak and useless all those years in college. I
        knew I was smart and that I could write well because I spent so much
        time reading books and writing down my thoughts, but I didn't think I
        could follow through with a long-term goal because deep down I really
        didn't know what I wanted to do. All I knew was that I wanted to earn a
        college degree just so that I can tell myself I am capable of earning a
        college degree and to make myself just a little bit more 'relevant’ or
        ‘competitive’ in the job market. God forbid you enter the job market
        without a college degree. You'll be exploited with low wages for the
        rest of your life.

        I read a great deal Los Angeles. I read a lot. You don’t understand how
        much I've read. I read books like there was tomorrow. Like I didn't have
        any goals or desire to form meaningful relationships with people or a
        career. I lived my life as if I were already planning on being dead by
        the time I would be 30. I must have been really insecure about not
        having any career goals or plans outside of college. I remember
        struggling a lot with anxiety, sadness and anger, this general feeling
        that my life wasn't really going anywhere and I didn't want it to go
        anywhere.
