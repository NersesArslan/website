      <h1>An Ocean of Time</h1>
      <p>
        I wonder if it’s possible to write without ego. I remember writing
        stories when I was a teenager whenever I had free time. I had just
        started reading for fun and was obsessed with using new words to craft
        sentences. Even if they didn’t amount to a story or a full paragraph. I
        had a curiosity and insatiable hunger to read and write. I had a very
        strong imagination that was also fed by the books that I’d spend most of
        my free time reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote a few stories, one that I remember publishing in my high school
        newsletter. It as well received and a lot of people were impressed by
        it. It made me feel special in a way that getting good grades could not.
        I remember a girl in my bus telling me how great a writer I was. We
        started talking more and I eventually became infatuated with her. My
        writing and command of the English language commanded respect. I was
        held in high esteem, not just by my English teacher, but by my
        classmates, my parents and friends. I had built an identity around this
        one thing that I was good at. I would later focus more of my time
        studying to get good grades so that I can get accepted at a good
        college. I excelled in math and physics and the other sciences. I had
        built an identity and based my self-worth on my ability to be good at
        math and the sciences. I had built an identity out of being a good and
        well-mannered student. I was a young promising teenager with the whole
        world ahead of him.
      </p>

        That was the memory that persists of my teenage year up until high
        school. I always remember the good stuff and forget about the bad stuff.
        Like my parents separating, my shyness, my inability to speak good
        enough Arabic to get along with most people in my own country, my
        nascent depression and my all too normal insecurities. I didn’t know it
        at the time but I had it great. Even with my parents separation, they
        continued to provide my sister and me with a lot of financial and
        emotional support. They gave me the freedom to do whatever I wanted to
        do and to think for myself. They gave me freedom to choose whatever
        career I wanted to pursue instead of pushing me into engineering or
        medicine. They gave me everything I would need to flourish as an adult.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t know why I did not pursue a career in writing. I had the knack
        for it. I definitely had or still have the ego, the need to say
        something and the curiosity to learn about new things. I had a very
        studious way going about my life. Always going from one point to another
        examining the best course of action. Too cautious to take risks but
        prudent enough to avoid mistakes. Until my ego got the better of me and
        devoured me from within while I was trying to put on the appearance of
        living a respectable life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t write because I thought my studies were more important than my
        fanciful dreams of becoming a writer. I eventually replaced that dream
        with wanting to become an academic because there was still something
        romantic and noble about it. To be an intellectual that spent his time
        thinking and writing about important matters in research journals and
        molding young students into independent thinkers. There was a touch of
        ego about it that I never came to terms with. A pride from just doing
        what I really wanted and thought would be best for me. Also, a fear of
        failure.
