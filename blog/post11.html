      <h1>Los Angeles is a Whore (Part 1)</h1>
      <p>
        Los Angeles is a whore. What do I mean by this? I find myself struggling
        to articulate to myself the circumstances that have brought me here. I
        am not one of those aspiring actors, musicians or social media
        influencers wanting to carve out a name for myself. I did not come here
        to make a lot of money so that I can buy a nice house in a good
        neighborhood with a backyard, although that does sound like something
        nice, something that would make me feel good about myself even though
        deep down I know that wealth and status will never make me feel whole.
        What I wanted was a new life.

        My name is Nerses and all that I wanted when I first moved to Los
        Angeles was a job, a roof over my head and being able to have regular
        meals.. Anything extra was a blessing. I did not think about the rising
        cost of living, I was acutely aware of how unaffordable housing is
        becoming in Los Angeles but I did not think about it because my mind was
        on finding and holding down whatever job I could get my hands on. I was
        grateful to just be in good health and enjoy my free time doing simple
        things. Reading, taking walks, listening to music, meeting interesting
        people and having deep and engaging conversations with them.

        I don’t know when I first started feeling dissatisfied with work and the
        direction that my life was going. It actually felt like my life wasn’t
        going anywhere, that this job would just take up a whole chunk of my
        time and pay me just enough so that I can live in my humble
        circumstances. What’s more, I started to feel a longing, a desire to be
        intimate with a woman and feel safe and vulnerable with her. But I
        didn’t have a car, I didn’t have a lot of money and I definitely did not
        have the confidence to talk to women. This was a little over two years
        ago and I felt incredibly dissatisfied and unhappy with my life
        circumstances even though I had a good foundation for building a future
        in a new country.

        Why are you so fucking expensive Los Angeles? I know why but I’m asking
        because I am now having to work at a job that I drive 25 miles to get
        to. I spend 40 hours a day, more if I count the time it takes me to get
        there and back, working at this jewelry company. This job is my only
        source of income and like most people with jobs, I am at once helpless
        and resigned to doing whatever it is my employers ask me to do, even if
        it can feel overwhelming at times and incredibly frustrating because I
        rely on my income to pay most of my expenses. I cannot even support
        myself with my job and am not seeing my attitude towards it getting any
        more positive despite my having a great working relationship with people
        there. I understand the value of work and responsibility. I just feel
        taken advantage of because of the relatively low pay with no benefits.

        Los Angeles, do you hear me? Los Angeles are you listening? You’ve got
        me working for the first time in my life. This pseudo-intellectual
        slacker that was too lazy and set in his own ways to go out and get a
        job in his home country. You got me banging on doors selling AT&amp;T to
        small businesses. You got me spending hours in front of a computer doing
        repetitive data entry for hours on end. You put me outside of my comfort
        zone my having me navigate the delicate boundaries with roommates who
        are struggling with their own problems. You got me feeling more lonely
        than I have ever felt at any other point in my life, and this is not
        your fault Los Angeles. No one forced me to leave my home country and
        family behind. I always had a choice even when it didn’t feel like I had
        much of a choice once my country started collapsing. For all your
        faults, I can’t blame you for the difficulty of living thousands of
        miles away from my mother, father and sister. I cannot blame you for my
        father’s cancer diagnosis when I was only three months living in
        Glendale with my grandmother and later her neighbor Harout. I cannot
        blame you for having to go back to see him while starting my second job
        at a jewellery company in Downtown Los Angeles. None of that was your
        fault, and especially not when I had to go back later in the year to see
        him when his condition got worse and he could barely talk. I cannot even
        blame Lebanon for his death. No one killed him. He had a choice to seek
        better treatment in the US but he refused. I must understand and try my
        best not to hold that decision against him because I sense that from his
        perspective he must not have felt like he had a choice either for
        wanting to stay in Lebanon to run his business while his cancer was
        eating away at his inside, much in the same way that I felt like I
        didn’t have a choice for wanting to leave Lebanon as soon as possible
        after seeing the currency collapse and the banks imposing limits on how
        much people could withdraw from their accounts. The ensuing protests and
        the covid-19 pandemic, and then the port blast that took the lives of
        two-hundred-plus people.

        It never felt like I had much of a choice. So why, O, why, do I have
        such a chip on my shoulder. I know why. Los Angeles why did you have to
        make me fall in love? Do I even want to write about this? The days,
        weeks and months I spent fantasizing about this girl. Too shy to talk to
        her and get to know her. I … I don’t know. I don’t know what we are now,
        but I know I spent a long time feeling a certain way about her when she
        would walk up the stairs and say ‘Good morning!’ The way she carried
        herself, her dark sense of humor, her putting up a strong front and wall
        only to let it down once in a while and show her soft side. I felt her
        and I wanted to get to know her more but I just didn’t know how Los
        Angeles. It was nowhere near as bad as when I lost my dad but why, then,
        did I cry so much when I found out she had a boyfriend? It was because I
        was meditating at the temple. Because I was not able to do anything but
        think about her and her having a boyfriend. I couldn’t sit and read
        anymore. I couldn’t drive in my car without thinking about her and how
        lonely and stupid I felt for feeling his way about her and having to
        wait eleven fucking months to have the nerve to ask her out. Fuck. Why
        am I this way Los Angeles? Why can’t I just relax and be friends with
        girls and get to know them and not have these weird conflicting feelings
        that make me want to push and pull them away? What am I so afraid of?
        That she’ll hurt me if I tell her how I really feel about her? That she
        won’t like me back? That she feels the same way and we go for it and
        someday it won't work out and I’ll feel even worse than when she told me
        she has a boyfriend. But she’s beautiful Los Angeles. I love her in my
        own way and I thank you for bringing her in my own life even if it was
        not meant to be. She told me to go after this new coworker and told me
        to take baby steps like when she and I first started to get to know each
        other when she asked me if I lived with monks. She’s not perfect Los
        Angeles, but you have no idea how much time I’ve spent wondering if we
        would be perfect for each other. But now… even with my letting down that
        wall I put between her and myself, I feel like it’s better for us to
        stay friends, even if I feel strongly about her. Her smile makes my
        heart sing. Her laugh makes me smile. I love her Los Angeles. Can you
        please be good to her?

        Listen Los Angeles. Listen closely. Do you remember when we first met,
        all those years ago? Do you remember when I visited you with my cousin
        Varant in 2011, whom I have not seen since I was a child? Do you
        remember when we walked in Venice with his Australian friend who flew
        all the way from Seattle to see him? Do you remember the things we
        talked about, about life, his decision to become a monk, my problems
        with my family, my mom and dad fighting and separating, my fight with my
        own aunt Laura. My own fears and insecurities about not being able to
        fit in or get a girlfriend. Do you remember? It was all so long ago, and
        I don’t remember the words but I remember how Varant was one of the few
        people who I felt truly understood me and tried to listen to me. I
        remember feeling very angry and that I was trying to justify my anger
        because of mom and dad splitting up. I remember drinking up the streets
        of Venice Beach. How I very much wanted to live in California and live
        among the hipsters. I was seventeen. I very much wanted to live in a
        first world country but I knew I had to go back to Lebanon to finish my
        degree. I was enchanted by you Los Angeles. You were so beautiful and
        new to a young boy in Beirut. You were full of promise and unrealized
        dreams. You were my future back then. Now I am here and I am yours. I am
        both horrified and humbled at what I see. The loneliness and squalor of
        your streets. The piss and stink of Downtown Los Angeles and the
        homeless strewn across your county but policed out of your ‘nicer’
        cities. Manhattan Beach threw me off guard. I instantly wanted to earn
        more money to buy a house there. I wanted to become, and still aspire to
        become a software developer. So that I can make more money to buy
        property, somewhere like Manhattan Beach. So that I can take nice long
        walks by the boardwalk and dine in nice restaurants and cafes within
        walking distance and read a good book as the sun sets and rises. I very
        much wanted to live close to the sea. But I’m still here Los Angeles.
        Living at $25/hour. Not enough to get by and burning through my savings
        and inheritance. I am grateful Los Angeles. My Zen practice keeps me
        grounded. My friend Gensan helped me through some hard times. He and
        Myoren have given me a lot of strength and guidance through our Zen
        practice. I met Chigan Roshi and Yoshin. I met Minakawa Roshi. I did my
        first sesshin with Varant. I felt the beauty the stillness of the
        present moment. I felt complete and in awe of the very act of being
        alive. You do not understand how much I had to let go to get here Los
        Angeles. You do not know how much I’ve practiced building walls around
        me. I still have walls around me and if it weren’t for my friends
        Gensan, Ashley, Myoren, Jion, George and Gilbert and for family like
        Eddie, Cynthia, Varant and grandma Yeghsabeth and uncle Raffi and
        Harout, I would be more cold and alone than I feel right now.

        I made a fire for both of us in my backyard. I was feeling cold and my
        hands get numb when they get cold. Here, come closer. Put your hands
        close to the fire and rub them together like this. See? Do you know that
        Gordon Lightfoot song “If You Can Read My Mind?”. It goes like this: “If
        you can read my mind love/ what a tale my thoughts could tell/ just like
        an old time movie/ ‘bout a ghost from a wishing well…”<br />This is what
        this whole thing feels like. I feel like telling you everything, even
        you know everything about me since I moved here to be with you.

        Ashley had to say bye to you yesterday Los Angeles. You gave her a rough
        time when she first met you but she still cried when she left you. How
        you put a spell on those who still struggle with you. Will I cry when I
        leave you? Will I ever leave you? Los Angeles tell me something, do you
        like me? Do you love me? Do you even care? Sometimes I’m in love with
        you but sometimes I want to leave you because you make me feel bitter
        and poor. Sometimes you make me feel like the richest man in the world.
        My Zen practice, my spiritual life, which I never really cultivated,
        even though I sensed that there was a part of me that was trying to find
        spiritual answers by reading books like The Brother Karamazov,
        Steppenwolf, and Death and the Dervish. I thought I could find answers
        to the messiness and unfairness of life by studying philosophy. I
        thought I could find peace studying Wittgenstein. Something about his
        philosophical approach and the life he lived made me think he figured
        out the important questions of living a meaningful and happy life. But
        was one of the most miserable people to have ever lived. I don’t know
        what I was thinking, but I was looking for answers. All I sensed I was
        doing was playing intellectual games, trying to understand philosophical
        concepts and arguments and applying them to this or that problem. Deep
        down I wanted guidance to learn how to live my life. I stumbled into Zen
        because of my life circumstances. Varant told me about the Zen Center
        and he told me it would be a good opportunity to meet interesting
        people. He knew I did not have a Zen practice. He was trying to help me
        out because it was difficult to find an affordable place to live. I
        remember when Jion first showed me around. I remember meeting Monica in
        the kitchen. I remember moving into my room and seeing Tora, one of the
        cats, come to my room and rub herself against me. I remember John, Ron,
        Monica and Jose. Ron’s deep and sonorous voice and I remember John
        asking him in one of our first conversations in the kitchen if Ron is a
        voice actor. I remember it like it was yesterday. I remember Jamal and
        when Ashley moved in later. Monica and Jose moved out within the second
        month of my moving in. They bought a house together and got married. A
        young Japanese girl moved in shortly before they left, Moko. Then
        Myokyo, a Zen teacher with a title of Osho. Can you believe it Los
        Angeles? I’ve been at the Zen Center for over two and a half years. I
        did not come here to practice Zen. I started sitting Zazen at the temple
        when John came to my room one day and asked me if I wanted to sit. John
        of all people. It was hard. I didn’t know how to cross my legs properly
        and didn’t have any prior practice of meditating at a Zen temple. No one
        forced me. But I eventually started meditating in the evenings after
        work. I felt some pressure but no one forced me. Then… I felt some
        resistance and resentment for being asked to be Shoji. I did my first
        Zazenkai and I started crying in the middle of it. I didn’t know what
        was going on. Something inside me … it felt like the walls between the
        world and me dissolved and I felt raw, and vulnerable and like I
        couldn’t hide from anyone. I stopped going to sit sometime after and no
        one forced me to come back. I felt some resentment at having to live at
        a Zen Center because of my life circumstances, because I was making very
        little money with my last job. You saw me Los Angeles. You saw me get up
        in the morning, eat breakfast and wait for the bus to get to work. You
        saw how hard it was for me and how lonely and unhappy I felt. How little
        time I had to read books, how I felt like I couldn’t enjoy my life
        because what would happen is that the weekends would come and I would
        have some time to read books but the weekends would pass and after
        enough of them have passed I would find myself sitting in my chair with
        my book in my hand and say to myself “Is this it? Is this my life now?”.
        I woke up one day with the resolve to become a writer and started my
        blog. I woke up the next day and decided I wanted to become a software
        developer and started teaching myself HTML and CSS. I would wake up
        early in the mornings so that I can get an hour of coding under my belt
        before going to work and I would start feelings resentful and angry
        every time someone, my grandma, or someone from the Zen Center, wanted
        to spend time with me because it felt like it was taking time away from
        my learning how to code. I burnt myself out Los Angeles trying to teach
        myself how to code while working at my last job because I really wanted
        to become a software developer so that I could earn enough money to
        afford being with you. The truth is that you’re not a whore Los Angeles.
        You just made me feel like one.
