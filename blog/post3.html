        Mark Zuckerberg gave some great advice on a clip of his interview with
        Lex Friedman. Friedman asked him what advice he would give young people
        and he said something to the effect of: (1) make sure you surround
        yourself with the right people, or the kind of people that you will
        learn a lot from and (2) ask yourself what you are excited about in the
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also added focus on your health and relationships. But I already knew
        about those things. What struck me about his first answer is that it
        made me realize that the people I spent most of my time around in
        college did define a lot of who I am as a person. A lot of what I value
        in life is developed from the time I spent with long-time friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was his second answer that stuck with me though. I also had no
        concrete idea of what I wanted out of life and had no interest in
        pursuing any career. There was little, if anything, in the world that
        interested me so much other than philosophy and becoming an academic.
        Thinking about Zuckerberg's advice now makes me want to deeply consider
        if there's anything I'm excited about now. If there are any developments
        or trends whose outcome I'm invested in. The only thing I can thing that
        I can think about is how humanity will have to deal with pending
        existential threats: climate change, nuclear war, a pandemic with a much
        higher fatality rate, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zuckerberg's advice did make me think a lot about how people will deal
        with the challenges of climate change on a global scale. Whether we will
        be able to allocate our financial and technological resources to come up
        with long-term solutions to reverse or mitigate effects of climate
        change on a large scale. It made me think about what I think is actually
        going to happen when the effects get worse: that we will find ways to
        carve out habitable spaces in the world but that only a certain class of
        people (the 1%, the upper-middle class, basically anyone with capital)
        will have access to these spaces. The rest of humanity will either die
        from the impending catastrophes wrought by climate change (famine,
        floods, extreme weather that dries up formerly habitable parts of the
        world) or fight their way to the habitable spaces carved out by the 1%.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm not exactly excited about this in a positive sense. I know a lot of
        people are going to die and suffer from this. But this is something that
        I've wondered about for a long time. How humanity will one day deal with
        existential threats. Will we come together to find a solution with all
        the resources with our disposal or will we fight each other so we can
        have the few habitable spaces available? Seeing how the world dealt with
        the COVID-19 pandemic and seeing how my own country (Lebanon) dealt with
        the collapse of its economy, I am inclined to think that we will head
        for the latter.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am not that pessimistic as I once was about our place in the world or
        whether we deserve to die out in one big cosmic catastrophe. I think
        these challenges are something worth dedicating our lives to so that we
        can leave behind a better (or a slightly less damaged) world behind for
        future generations. It is a noble and worthwhile pursuit to be engaged
        in the effort to fight climate change, or if it is already too late, to
        mitigate the effects of the impending catastrophe. It is this sense of
        being part of a cause that is bigger than yourself, of sacrificing your
        time, effort, and resources for the well-being of generations down the
        line. It is this - being part of a collective effort to save ourselves
        and our future - that excites me.
