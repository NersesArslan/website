      <h1>Ludwig Wittgenstein</h1>

      <p>
        If someone were to ask me why I was obsessed with Wittgenstein and his
        philosophy when I was in college I would not be able to give them an
        answer off the top of my head. I've come to appreciate that I've
        developed a special relationship with Wittgenstein that I sometimes have
        trouble explaining to myself. I've admired other writers and
        intellectuals - David Foster Wallace, Roberto Bola√±o, Noam Chomsky and
        Fyodor Dostoevsky - but Ludwig Wittgenstein was special. It was not just
        his philosophy and the kind of questions his method of philosophy was
        raising. It was something about his character.

        As an introvert I had a very active and stimulating inner life that was
        difficult to share with others. I struggled to express my thoughts
        because I noticed that there was a huge gap between what I was thinking
        and what I was trying to say. The issue wasn't that I wasn't able to
        articulate these thoughts in language, I had a pretty good idea of what
        I wanted to express when I wrote it down on paper with time to think and
        revise my drafts. But when it came to expressing myself in front of
        people, classmates, friends, family or anyone with whom I tried having a
        deep conversation with, I struggled to express myself.

        A lot of it is nerves, but I would also like to think that it was a lack
        of experience in knowing how to talk with other people. The written word
        was my refuge for making sense of the world. But there were times when I
        couldn't make sense myself. Ever since I started reading books as a
        child I had this strange idea that, with practice, I could perfectly
        express every thought that would ever come across my mind. With time and
        plenty of practice, I started becoming a better writer. My talent showed
        itself in my English class and my habit to scribble stories on my
        notebooks and laptop.

        Some time around college I found myself being better able to express
        myself around people. I still struggled with awkwardness and being able
        to gauge a flow of conversation, but around certain people, friends and
        professors, I started being able to express myself in ways that I was
        previously not able to. I was able to think and speak clearly. What's
        more, in certain instances, I felt like I was able to command respect
        from others with what I said and how I said it. I started to have a
        growing appreciation for the spoken<em> </em>word.

        What drew me to Wittgenstein and his philosophy were his observations
        about language. Specifically with how he approached philosophical
        problems in a novel way, by focusing language, the medium though which
        philosophical problems are articulated rather than the philosophical
        problems themselves. Of course I was also drawn by his sparse, cryptic
        and even sometimes lyrical sentences in the <em>Tractactus</em>.

          Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death. If
          we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but
          timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the
          present. Our life has no end in the way in which our visual field has
          no limits.

        As someone who was committed to pursue a career in philosophy, I took
        philosophical problems seriously. I thought that that one of the most
        serious problems was finding out how to live a meaningful life in the
        modern world. I thought that there were problems in how people lived in
        their day to day life, going to work and coming home, without giving
        much thought to important things like politics, climate change, what it
        means to be good, and how we reduce rising levels of inequality.

        I think it was how true he was to himself and his philosophy. The fact
        that he never pursued a career in academia (as a matter of fact he
        seemed to abhor the trappings of academic life). The fact that he signed
        up to the front in WWI despite coming from one of the richest families
        in Europe. The fact that he gave away his inheritance to his sisters.
        The fact that he lived an ascetic life pursuing what he was passionate
        about.

        I was deeply concerned with how little thought most people around me
        gave to the problem that I spent most of my time thinking about. I even
        struggled with existential depression and anxiety, and often turned to
        reading philosophy for solace. Reading Wittgenstein's philosophy and
        about his life was the closest I felt to finding answers to some of
        those problems. His thinking cut through a lot of academic
        <s>bullshit</s> formality and touched on deep questions, not just one
        the philosophical problems that pre-occupied me, but the spiritual and
        existential problems that I struggled to cope with.

        Even if I never go back to studying philosophy and pursue a career in
        academia or teaching, I feel deeply indebted to him and his writings.
