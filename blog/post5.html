        I started reading Tony Judt's Postwar a few weeks into Russia's invasion
        of Ukraine. I have been wanting to read the book for a long time but
        couldn't make time for it. Something about the invasion compelled me to
        get out of my way to make time to reading this 800+ page tome about
        Europe's Post-war history.

        I never went out of my way to read non-fiction. But I started making a
        habit to have a non-fiction book laying around my pile a few years ago.
        I thought it would be a waste to spend all my years reading fiction
        without making an effort to read non-fiction. After all, there are few
        people out there who have the time or the inclination to sit down and
        read a book. How wasteful would it be as a lifelong reader to make it a
        point to only read fiction when I have the habit and temperament to read
        just about anything if only I made the time for it?

        I value this habit of reading because it gives me privileged access to
        an author's mind that I cannot have when looking up results in a search
        engine or a Wikipedia page. It's not just that Judt is laying out a
        detailed account of the historical events, but he is providing context
        and commentary to certain events that adds a certain kind of substance.
        It's the kind of historical interpretation and commentary that gives you
        insight as to why certain things happened the way they did.

        What really surprises me when I read history books like Judt's Postwar
        is how caricatured and sanitized our idea of certain historical events
        are. I thought that Germany's division into East and West was planned
        form the start. That the Allied and Soviet zones in Berlin were set up
        as soon as the dust settled off of WWII and that it was part of some
        sort of agreement between the western Allies and the Soviet Union.
        According to Judt, this split between West and East Germany and Berlin
        was a result of a series of miscalculations and misunderstandings
        between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. It was not at all planned.

        Another thing that threw me off guard was how bad Eastern Europeans had
        it under Communism (especially Eastern European Jews). I always had this
        intuitive sense that Eastern Europe was under developed and 'backwards'
        in many respects, but I had no understanding of why this was the case. I
        didn't know why Western Europe was so developed and prosperous either. I
        just took it for granted that there was something about the way the
        governments and economies were set up. But I had no idea how much the
        success of the postwar years in Western Europe were because of
        circumstance beyond each nations' control. I also had very little sense
        of the devastation and the hardships that many people across the
        continent had to face for several years after the war. I was both
        horrified and in awe of what people in different points in history have
        to go through just to survive. It helps put things in perspective.

        Did the book answer any questions about the current Russia-Ukraine
        invasion? Did it give me an understanding of why Putin would risk so
        much to invade another country? Not really. Well, at least not yet. I
        have not yet finished the book...

        Postwar made me realize how much our sense of history is distorted by
        propaganda or a very sanitized high-school-textbook-version of events
        when what actually happened was far more complicated.

        This also makes me want to ask the question: what are the consequences
        if most people around the world don't have a clear or coherent
        understanding of the historical events that shape and continue to shape
        the underlying structures of their present social, economic and
        political realities? How hard can it be for demagogues like Trump to
        sell an idea of the past if most people don't have clear idea of what
        actually happened?

        I guess this goes with the territory of not having enough time to sit
        down and read because of the constraints of having to work; and that
        most people these days would rather spend their time distracting
        themselves with their phones or laptop instead of sitting alone in a
        room reading.

        Is it just a matter of it being better to live in ignorance? That it's
        easier to accept our present realities by not investigating the chain of
        events that shape how things are now? I don't know.

        The greatest lesson I may have learned from history is how certain forms
        of nationalism always crops up when a country is faced with economic
        decline. That politicians aren't necessarily horrible human beings, but
        shrewd tacticians playing the long-game for the greater good of their
        nation. That economic considerations always factor into political
        decisions (and vice-versa). That war and conflict are inevitable.
