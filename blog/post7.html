      <h1>Work and Time Anxiety</h1>
      <p>
        I don't know what I set out to accomplish by writing my thoughts down
        here. I started working on this blog over a year ago, at a time when I
        decided that I should start focusing on something I am passionate about
        in my spare time. I was deeply unhappy with my job and decided to focus
        on writing.

        However, I decided to start focus on learning how to code the next day
        since I realized that the odds of making a living as a programmer are
        much better than that of being a writer. The issue was that I didn't
        know how to code. But I decided that if I wanted to improve my life and
        build on myself, it would be best to learn a skill that is in high
        demand. After all, I live in a highly competitive labor market where a
        degree in the social sciences or humanities will not guarantee or secure
        you a stable or well paying job. One of my cousins told me point blank
        when I complained about my low wage that I'm not owed anything. This is
        America. If I wanted a better quality of life, I had to work for it. One
        is not simply entitled to a good life here. You have to earn it.

        So I started spending my free time learning how to code. It was fun, for
        a while. I think what I struggled with most, what I still struggle with,
        is finding a balance between work, responsibility, and making time for
        friends and family. I really burnt myself out by making so much time for
        learning how to code. I learned a lot, I learned enough to make a simple
        static website with HTML and CSS, but I also felt tired and sleep
        deprived, especially because I spent so much of my time in front a
        computer screen at work and at home.

        I definitely struggled and was even more frustrated when people in my
        life were asking me to spend time with them. I had this very bad feeling
        that that the time I spend with them is time lost learning how to code
        and this thought and feeling persisted even when I was with my loved
        ones. So much so that it made me feel depressed. It made it hard for me
        to appreciate time with people and time doing things I liked, like
        reading books, going to the beach, listening to music, and taking long
        walks.

        Every aspect of my life started to feel like an effort to maximize my
        ability to learn how to code so that I can one day secure a job as a
        software developer. This sense of time anxiety actually started since I
        started working full time, before I even started learning how to code.
        But it got worse and more acute the more dissatisfied I felt with my job
        and the more I felt like there was no way out of my job. It felt like I
        was stuck in a loop where I would not be able to afford a better life
        for myself if I didn't work really hard to get a better job.

        This is something I still struggle with, even with a better paying job
        in a better work environment. I think it is a characteristic of living
        in a highly developed capitalist society. In order to live we need to
        earn money to pay for our basic expenses, but we give up so much of our
        time for out work that not only do we not feel that the time at work is
        not ours, but that our 'free' time after work is constrained to such a
        small part of our lives that we have to make the most of it. Every
        weekend has to be perfectly orchestrated, every conversation needs to
        have a certain flow or point to it; you get frustrated and impatient
        with traffic and even small stuff like waiting in line at a grocery
        store. It's hard to savor the moment because of this constant anxiety at
        the back of our minds that our time isn't really ours.

        I am not trying to say that people shouldn't work. I have grown a lot
        since I moved to the US and started doing the basic adult stuff. I wish
        I have done this earlier so that I would have matured at a younger age,
        but I am both grateful and humbled by this experience. If anything,
        working at a job that I don't like has made me appreciate the little
        things in life and has given me a different, and I would say, more
        grounded perspective in life.
