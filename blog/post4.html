      <h1>An Ode to Capitalism</h1>
      <p>
        Do I have anything important to say? About anything? Am I slowly
        becoming one of those people that don't have any real thoughts or
        opinions on anything? Someone who has a list of stock phrases whenever
        someone asks them about their view on things? Or am I slowly becoming
        more entrenched in the realities of becoming an adult in a developed
        country? Where it is difficult to find enough time for yourself to read
        and think about things so that you have a deeper understanding of them.

        I replayed Ted Chiang's interview with Ezra Klein on the Ezra Klein Show
        and he said something to the effect that it's not AI or the future of
        tech that worries him but the extent to which the tech industry is
        embedded in capitalism . It echoes Blake Lemoine's, the software
        engineer who got suspended by Google for publicly airing out his
        concerns about Google's AI project LaMBDA becoming sentient, claim that
        it is not that there are bad people at Google but that Google as a
        corporation exists in an environment where business interests
        (collection data on its users, maximizing revenue, buying out
        competition etc.) are prioritized over ethical considerations.

        If the tech world is the last refuge of hope for the future, it is
        because technology has become so integrated with our lives that it is
        becoming impossible to imagine our lives without it. We don't need our
        phones and laptops to live as human beings. It is just that the demands
        of living in a post-industrial economy has turned that which was once a
        convenience - quick and easy access to information - into a necessity.

        I have no issue with this since no one is forcing me to live like a
        normal person. If I really wanted to I could opt out from living in
        modern society and learn survival skills so I can live on my own in the
        woods. The issue is that life even in a developed country with an
        advanced economy is unbearably stressful and unfulfilling. Unless you
        have some real friends or relationships with whom you can share ideas or
        talk to about your problems or things that you really care about; or
        some strong sense of purpose or a set of values that you can build your
        life around; or a hobby or passion that you can cultivate toward
        something fruitful, your life will inevitably become a monotonous
        routine of waking up and getting ready for work.

        The worst part is that I have a strong feeling that I am compromising
        some of my core values. It's not that I don't think people should not
        work and take care of themselves. It's just that I am in a position
        where I have to find a way to get into job that pays me more so that I
        can have a better future ahead of me. While there certainly is a part of
        me that really wants that, I can't help but feel that just by thinking
        about my future in those terms means that I have pretty much sold out to
        capitalism and that I am a willing participant in an economic system
        that claims to be egalitarian but isn't.

        Los Angeles is a beautiful place to live. But it is also place where the
        extreme pros and cons of capitalism converge: a lot of job
        opportunities, access to high end consumer goods and services, nice
        gentrified neighborhoods and clean beaches but also high cost of living,
        one of the highest homeless populations in the world, inadequate public
        transportation and (arguably) no social safety net.

        There is an appeal to living in a highly capitalistic society in that
        you think that you can make it if you just work hard enough. When you do
        you get to buy property and travel around the world and do all those
        things that purportedly constitute a meaningful and fulfilling life. But
        if you don't, you end up becoming one of those embittered people that
        curse their luck and find some story to tell themselves to assuage their
        sense of personal failure.

        Living in the U.S. for the past several months keeps bringing me back to
        that line from <em>The Wire</em>: "the game is rigged, but you cannot
        lose if you do not play."

        I do not want to lose and I do not want to play. But I need to pay my
        rent.
