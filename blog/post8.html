      <h1>Sitting</h1>
      <p>
        I've been going through a lot the past few months. I don't even know
        where to start. I haven't written in a long time because I was trying
        really hard to work on coding projects, I really went hard at trying to
        teach myself the basics of web development while holding down a full
        time job. But even after I stopped teaching myself how to code, I never
        went back to writing.

        I had a spell of depression when my roommates moved out back in November
        and had struggled to adapt to the social isolation. I already spent a
        lot of time outside of work alone, I'd usually stick to some habits that
        I've cultivated since I settled down into my routine at my job. But I
        found myself unable to enjoy some of these habits, especially when I
        felt more lonely than usual.

        Something in me started to change. My cousin from Japan was in town to
        lead a retreat at the Zen Center. He brought some of his friends from
        Japan with him. I have stopped sitting at the temple since my roommates
        moved out. I was struggling with loneliness and this feeling that my
        life wasn't going anywhere. But when he came, I felt a strong desire to
        spend time with my cousin. A lot of people want to be around him every
        time he comes back from Japan because they don't get to see him often.
        He usually comes a few weeks a year and there's a lot of people, family
        and friends, that want to catch-up with him every time he comes back to
        Los Angeles. So that it's hard to have any one-on-one time with him.

        I was hoping to have some one-on-one time with him this time, but I
        found myself always at the periphery, always waiting for some time alone
        with him. One day he and his friends were going on their way to Mt.
        Baldy and asked me if I'd come. I hesitated and didn't really want to
        drive all the way to Mt. Baldy with a bunch of people especially after
        waking up that morning slightly hungover after a party the night before.
        I was feeling pretty tired, depressed and moody. But something in me
        clicked - I don't get to see my cousin all that often, and it would be
        better to spend time with him with other people, even if it meant doing
        something I didn't want to do, than staying at home and being alone.

        I texted a girl that I liked on the car ride to Mt. Baldy. She invited
        me to a rave the day before, and I didn't want to go at first because it
        started pretty late and because I don't feel comfortable going to a show
        with loud music in a crowded space. The main reason I hesitated is
        because I really liked her and I was afraid of getting closer to her
        because of this fear of getting more attached to her. I decided to go
        because I liked her for so long since I met her without taking any steps
        of getting to know her or see her. I was terrified.

        I really don't want to write about her. I feel very uncomfortable with
        how much time I've spent thinking about her and how she makes me feel.
        I'm starting to think that the problem isn't her, but the way I process
        and react to my feelings when I like a girl. I get really anxious and
        scared, like I can't accept the fact that I have these feelings, this
        need to be close and intimate with someone, because these feelings make
        me feel like I'm not in control.

        I asked her out to dinner two weeks later and she told me that she's
        already seeing someone. I got really depressed and started sitting in
        the temple regularly again. The timing was great because my Zen Center
        started a Spring Ango, a five week period where they held three long
        retreats and one short one.

        I cried a lot and felt overwhelmed with my feelings. I must have cried a
        lot more in those five weeks than when my father passed away, not
        because of how much I liked the girl but because of how much I was
        sitting and how often I had to confront my thoughts and feelings while I
        was sitting all that time. I had met some interesting people during the
        Ango. I talked about my feelings for this girl with some people and one
        roommate who moved in told me about his experience with relationships
        and encouraged me to accept this pain and grow from it instead of trying
        to repress it. He told me it was a good opportunity for my Zen practice.
        He said something to the effect that "when you have something like that
        in your life, it gives fuel to your practice. Otherwise your pratice
        would be sterile."

        The experience of sitting regularly at a temple while processing these
        feelings made me realize certain things about myself and the way I react
        to pain. It also made me appreciate the nature and function of pain in
        human life. Pain is an inevitable part of human life. As long as you are
        a living breathing human being, as long as you have a head, a heart and
        bodily sensations, you will feel pain. Put your hands too close to the
        fire, and you will feel pain. Break-up with your partner, you will feel
        pain. Lose your life savings, you will feel pain. But the greatest
        insight I've had is making this distinction between pain and suffering.
        While pain is an inevitable feature of human life, suffering is
        something else, something that comes from how we react to pain.

        I have a tendency to get lost in my thoughts. I find myself brooding
        over things in my day-to-day life, things that are often petty or
        trivial, that really bring me down. Since I started sitting regularly at
        the temple I realized that it's not whatever trivial things that
        happened to me that's bothering me, but my mind's tendency to fixate on
        things. I am drawn to negativity, I like feeling sad, angry and
        hopeless, for whatever reason. I have struggled with depression and
        anxiety for a long time. It is only when I sit long enough with my
        thoughts, feelings, my body while paying attention to my posture and
        breathing that I realized that these thoughts and feelings are just
        temporary. It's ok to have uncomfortable thoughts and feelings. It only
        becomes a problem when you fixate on them, you start having an opinion
        or judgments about those thoughts, like "I'm a bad person for not being
        able to get over this girl" or "I shouldn't be so weak, I need to get
        over this ASAP."
      </p>
      <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

      <!-- wp:paragraph -->
      <p>
        This is called attachment. It's when we assign a value, a judgment, or
        opinion to something. When you practice sitting long enough, you start
        noticing how your mind and body sifts through thoughts, feelings and
        bodily sensations like a stream in a river. I still struggle with my
        mind when I sit, especially when I'm not paying attention to my
        breathing, but I notice how most of my problems come from spending so
        much energy trying to control my and repress thoughts and feeling
        instead of letting them be. I noticed how I struggle with perfectionism
        and being hard on myself, how I constantly put myself down for not
        meeting certain goals, for struggling to find a romantic partner and
        figuring out my career path since I started working. It didn't occur to
        me that these things take time, effort and patience and that a lot of it
        is out of our control.

        I realize that I have this tendency to always search for something,
        always find something wrong in myself and my current situation, no
        matter how good my life circumstances may seem. I do not want to present
        Zen practice as an answer to any of life's questions or therapy for
        people who feel lost or confused in life. The point is to practice it
        with no expectation or idea of what it is. I still struggle with little
        things in my life to this day but with the practice I feel a lot more
        calm and tranquil, a lot less ruffled by the vicissitudes of life.
