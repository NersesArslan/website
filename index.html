        My name is Nerses. I've been teaching myself the basics of web
        development on an off for the past two and a half years. I've been
        slacking off a lot the past year, especially when I was working at my
        last job and starting practicing
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazen">Zazen</a> more seriously.

      <p>Here's a picture of me:</p>
      <img src="images/reading.jpg" alt="" class="profile-picture" />

      <p>
        Hm, that doesn't seem like a nice picture, you don't get to see my face.
        Here's a headshot:

      <img
        src="images/PXL_20240626_145405240.jpg"
        alt=""
        class="profile-picture"
      />
      <p>
        Ugh... that picture makes me look like a real sourpuss. It looks like
        I'm not impressed by Grand Central Station. Here's another one:
      </p>
      <div class="wrap">
        <img
          src="images/PXL_20240626_230833666.MP.jpg"
          alt=""
          class="profile-picture third"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        There we go! A picture of me smiling. Third time's the charm. &#128516
