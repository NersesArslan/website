      <h1>Hello World!</h1>

      <p>
        My name is Nerses. I've been teaching myself the basics of web
        development on an off for the past two and a half years. I've been
        slacking off a lot the past year, especially when I was working at my
        last job and starting practicing
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazen">Zazen</a> more seriously
        last year.
      </p>
      <p>Here's a picture of me.</p>
      <img src="images/reading.jpg" alt="" class="profile-picture" />

      <p>
        Hm, that doesn't seem like a nice picture, you don't get to see my face.
        Here's a headshot.

      <img
        src="images/PXL_20240626_145405240.jpg"
        alt=""
        class="profile-picture"
      />
      <p>
        Ugh... that picture makes me look like a real sourpuss. It looks like
        I'm not impressed by Grand Central Station.

        alt=""

      />
      <p>
        There we go! A picture of me smiling. Now all I need to do is learn
        enough css to crop out my cousin Gaby or ask him for permission to use
        his picture in my personal website... which Im too socially anxious to
        do. So crop him out we shall!
